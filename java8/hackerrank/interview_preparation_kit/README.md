# HackerRank interview preparation kit
Solutions for the interview preperation kit section in hackerrank site.
### Note
As the hackerrank code verification mechanism requires the Java file to have main class as **Solution** 
I just kept the class name as Solution, but the file name is chosen to suite with the problem. 
For executing a program say X.java in local, do the following in the terminal.

```
$ cp X.java Solution.java
$ javac Solution.java
$ java Solution
```
